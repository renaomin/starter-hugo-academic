title: Inner Core Boundary
summary: |
  The Earth's solid inner core grows from the solidification of the liquid
  outer core. The solidificaiton process releases latent heat and expels
  light elements, providing driving forces for the outer core convection
  and the geodynamo which generates the Earth's magnetic field.
  The information of the Earth's inner core boundary (ICB) is important
  for our understanding of the thermo-compositional state of the Earth's core.
  We use seismic waves reflected from the Earth's ICB to study the spatial and
  temporary changes of ICB.

The Earth's solid inner core grows from the solidification of the liquid
outer core. The solidification process releases latent heat and expels
light elements, providing driving forces for the outer core convection
and the geodynamo which generates the Earth's magnetic field.
Thus, the information of the Earth's inner core boundary is
important for our understanding of the thermo-compositional state of the Earth's core.
